# Coursework
Hello everyone, I'm Alona, a Junior Front-End Developer, and this is a course work for the Front-End courses of Beetroot Academy. 

This is a responsive website called Atolla. The template was taken from Figma. 
The link to the template https://www.figma.com/file/QqS2FvQ67tCMkagWAhR2Yl/Atolla?node-id=0%3A1.

I changed some features from the template according to the responsiveness and the preferences, so that this website looks completed and appealing to users. 

To create this project, I used such technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- Framework Vue.js

I implemented modern features of front-end development as much as I could to represent a user-friendly website. 

I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do! Thank you for your attention!
